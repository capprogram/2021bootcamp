Check out [this link](http://mattpitkin.github.io/samplers-demo/pages/samplers-samplers-everywhere/) on different types of samplers. This includes MCMC sampling (which we should already have some experience with) along with nested samplers. This tutorial is fairly long, so feel free to look into it as long as it is interesting to you. It also cites a shorter, yet similar tutorial by Jake VanderPlas at the top that may be helpful as well.
