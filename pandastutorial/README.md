Check out the [10 Minutes to pandas guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/10min.html) to see if you'd like to learn more about this powerful data manipulation package. If you've learned about jupyter notebooks, you can play with some useful pandas commands in this pandas tutorial notebook.

This tutorial is intended to be done in the Binder environment. To do this tutorial:
 * If you don't have Binder already loaded up, go to https://mybinder.org/ and enter the url "https://github.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp" into the github repo line and press "launch"
 * It can take up to 10 minutes to load the boot camp repo into Binder
 * After it is loaded, use the file explorer on the left to open the `pandas_tutorial.ipynb` file in the `pandastutorial` folder
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter. 

If the above instructions aren't working for you, feel free to use these alternative instructions to access the `pandas_tutorial.ipynb` tutorial:

 * go to https://jupyter.org/try
 * click "Try JupyterLab"
 * open a terminal in the Lab (File>New>Terminal)
 * paste the following 2 lines into the terminal to get the jupyter notebook and data set:<br/>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/pandastutorial/pandas_tutorial.ipynb?token=AHJ5VUGIIMO6YM2G4Z2SNKTAYKAM2 -O /home/jovyan/demo/pandas_tutorial.ipynb` <br/>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/pandastutorial/ECO_DR1_withradec.csv?token=AHJ5VUGLJURVZDMPWRE6FK3AYKAMY -O /home/jovyan/demo/ECO_DR1_withradec.csv`
 
 * if necessary, click the refresh page (curled arrow) at the top of the webpage
 * launch the jupyter notebook by double clicking on it
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter
