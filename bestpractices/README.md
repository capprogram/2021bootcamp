## Programming Best Practices

Updated to JupyterLab format June 2021

This tutorial is intended to be done in the Binder environment. To do this tutorial:
 * If you don't have Binder already loaded up, go to https://mybinder.org/ and enter the url "https://github.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp"
 * It can take up to 10 minutes to load the boot camp repo into Binder
 * After it is loaded, use the file explorer on the left to open the `bestpractices.ipynb` file in the `bestpractices` folder
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter. 

If the above instructions aren't working for you, feel free to use these alternative instructions to access the `bestpractices.ipynb` tutorial:

 * go to https://jupyter.org/try
 * click "Try JupyterLab"
 * open a terminal in the Lab (File>New>Terminal)
 * paste the following into the terminal to get the jupyter notebook:<br/>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/bestpractices/bestpractices.ipynb?token=AHJ5VUG7KZN7DQVL45YW2EDAYJUPW -O /home/jovyan/demo/bestpractices.ipynb`
 * paste both of the following into the terminal to get the two python codes:<br/>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/bestpractices/templatecode.py?token=AHJ5VUHTDGUXDHVFQCVDUADAYJURW -O /home/jovyan/demo/templatecode.py` <br>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/bestpractices/templatecodeprotected.py?token=AHJ5VUFCDDTBPFDX47ETTQ3AYJUQ6 -O /home/jovyan/demo/templatecodeprotected.py`
 * if necessary, click the refresh page (curled arrow) at the top of the webpage
 * launch the jupyter notebook by double clicking on it
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the bestpractices.ipynb jupyter notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter
 * you can view/edit individual python codes outside the jupyter notebook by double clicking on them in the list of files on the left side of the jupyter lab window, then viewing/editing them in the windows that pop up
 * you will edit the code you're fixing outside the notebook, then re-run it by re-executing the cell that calls the code inside the notebook
