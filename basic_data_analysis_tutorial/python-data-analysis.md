# Python Basic Data Analysis Tutorial

To learn to load, manipulate, and plot data, complete the following tutorial.

The tutorial assumes you will use the graphical Spyder interface in the Anaconda distribution of python, and explains how to install Anaconda. If you want to use Python in a terminal instead, look at these [alternative instructions and commands](https://github.com/capprogram/2017bootcamp-general/blob/master/ipython-terminal.md) for use with ipython on the linux command line. 

Here is a one page [Quick Reference](http://user.physics.unc.edu/~sheila/PythonQuickReference.pdf) for the commands used in this tutorial.

## Part I: Installation of Anaconda

See installation instructions for your [personal laptop](https://github.com/capprogram/2017bootcamp-general/blob/master/python-setup-laptop.md) or a [department workstation](https://github.com/capprogram/2017bootcamp-general/blob/master/python-setup-linux.md). Make sure to install Python 3.0 or higher. 

## Part II: Getting Started and Recording Your Work

After installing Anaconda, search for anaconda on your computer and open up the anaconda navigator app which will have a nice user interface. Then, find the "Spyder" app.
