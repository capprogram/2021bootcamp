# Python Basic Data Analysis Tutorial

To learn to load, manipulate, and plot data, complete the following tutorial.

The tutorial assumes you will use the graphical Spyder interface in the Anaconda distribution of python, and explains how to install Anaconda. If you want to use Python in a terminal instead, look at these [alternative instructions and commands](https://github.com/capprogram/2017bootcamp-general/blob/master/ipython-terminal.md) for use with ipython on the linux command line. 

Here is a one page [Quick Reference](http://user.physics.unc.edu/~sheila/PythonQuickReference.pdf) for the commands used in this tutorial.

## Part I: Installation of Anaconda

See installation instructions for your [personal laptop](https://github.com/capprogram/2017bootcamp-general/blob/master/python-setup-laptop.md) or a [department workstation](https://github.com/capprogram/2017bootcamp-general/blob/master/python-setup-linux.md). Make sure to install Python 3.0 or higher. 

## Part II: Getting Started and Recording Your Work

After installing Anaconda, find the "Spyder" app in the installation folder or your programs menu, which will provide a nice user interface. On the department astro linux machines, you can simply type `spyder` in the command prompt after you have activated `unc_anaconda` and your virtualenv `astro` (for details see instructions for setup). Spyder may take a while to start up, because of all the python libraries it is loading.
