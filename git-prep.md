# 1. Sign up for GitHub

1. Visit https://github.com/ and pick a username to set up an account. Youâ€™ll probably use GitHub long past this boot camp, so bear that in mind when deciding what email address to give.

2. Give us your username so we can invite you to join the `capprogram` organization.

3. Visit https://github.com/capprogram to accept the invitation to join the team
`2017_bootcamp_participants`.

# 2. Install Git

Git is pre-installed on all linux machines. Install git for your laptop from one of these links:

1. [Install for MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
2. [Install for Win](https://git-for-windows.github.io) -- all defaults are fine except you may prefer to decline credential manager

For now, just install Git and we can play with it later. Return back to the main wiki and continue with the tutorials
