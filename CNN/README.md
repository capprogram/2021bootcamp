We will refer to [John Wu's github demo of convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/jwuphysics/convnet-demo) for this tutorial. First, skim over [this document](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#overview) that explains what CNN are and how they work. I would suggest having this document handy while going over the actual tutorial. 

To download the tutorial:
* First, click on the link to get to John Wu's github for the CNN demo.
* Open up git bash and type in `git clone https://github.com/jwuphysics/convnet-demo.git`
* Open up google drive and click on `new` > `folder upload` and then upload the folder that you just cloned. This may take a few minutes.
* Go into the folder you just uploaded and then into the notebooks folder and right-click on the file called "Metallicity prediction demo.py" and open it with google colaboratory. 
* Google Colaboratory is very similarly to JupyterLab, so run each cell by pressing shift+enter.
