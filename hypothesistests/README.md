## Hypothesis Tests for Correlations and Distributions

This tutorial is intended to be done in the Binder environment. To do this tutorial:
  * If you don't have Binder already loaded up, go to https://mybinder.org/ and enter the url "https://github.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp" into the github repo line and press "launch"
 * It can take up to 10 minutes to load the boot camp repo into Binder
 * After it is loaded, use the file explorer on the left to open the `hypothesistests.ipynb` file in the `hypothesistests` folder
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter. 

If the above instructions aren't working for you, feel free to use these alternative instructions to access the `hypothesistests.ipynb` tutorial:

 * go to https://jupyter.org/try
 * click "Try JupyterLab"
 * close open tabs in the Lab (not necessary, just less confusing)
 * open a terminal in the Lab (File>New>Terminal)
 * paste the following into the terminal to get the jupyter notebook:<br/>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/hypothesistests/hypothesistests.ipynb?token=AHJ5VUCYJMESMGIOKEAR443AYKW2O -O /home/jovyan/demo/hypothesistests.ipynb`
 * paste the following into the terminal to get the input file:<br/>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/hypothesistests/anscombe.txt?token=AHJ5VUGIVARK7GHKVWAJA5LAYKW4M -O /home/jovyan/demo/anscombe.txt` <br>
 * paste the following into the terminal to get the input file:<br/>
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/hypothesistests/ECO_dr1_subset.csv?token=AHJ5VUDBNP7MB3AM4GCKX4DAYKW56 -O /home/jovyan/demo/ECO_dr1_subset.csv` <br>
 * if necessary, click the refresh page (curled arrow) at the top of the webpage
 * launch the jupyter notebook by double clicking on it
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter
