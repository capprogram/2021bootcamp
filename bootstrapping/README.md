## Bootstrapping

This tutorial is intended to be done in the Binder environment. To do this tutorial:
 * If you don't have Binder already loaded up, go to https://mybinder.org/ and enter the url "https://github.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp" into the github repo line and press "launch"
 * It can take up to 10 minutes to load the boot camp repo into Binder
 * After it is loaded, use the file explorer on the left to open the `bootstrapping.ipynb` file in the `bootstrapping` folder
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter.

  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/bootstrapping/bootstrapping.ipynb?token=AHJ5VUGUAJYOXI4FVYYU6H3AYLFXA -O /home/jovyan/demo/bootstrapping.ipynb`
 * type the following into the terminal to get the astroML package:<br/>
   `pip install astroML`
 * if necessary, click the refresh page (curled arrow) at the top of the webpage
