## Exploring Jupyter Notebooks

This tutorial is **Optional**

Optional: Use these [jupyter notebook quickstart instructions](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to examine the example jupyter notebook called `ExploreRESOLVEandECO.ipynb` (found in the current repo; download by clicking "raw" then right-clicking the raw contents and choosing "save as"). In the first code block you may have to add this line to get it to work `!pip install astroML`. You can run this notebook partway through if you also download the `ECO_dr1_subset.csv` input file also provided in this repo. If you like the idea of being able to work in notebooks like this, then you can get comfortable with them first by finishing the example notebook (this effort will also give you a small taste of the sql database query language), then by creating your own jupyter notebook from scratch. For example, you could use ECO DR1 to plot stellar mass vs. environment distributions and compare them for early type and late type galaxies.















Below are additional instructions to open the `ExploreRESOLVEandECO.ipynb` tutorial in JupyterLab if you prefer that:

 * go to https://jupyter.org/try
 * click "Try JupyterLab"
 * close open tabs in the Lab (not necessary, just less confusing)
 * open a terminal in the Lab (File>New>Terminal)
 * paste the following lines into the terminal to get the jupyter notebook:<br/>
  
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/explorejupyternotebooks/ExploreRESOLVEandECO.ipynb -P /home/jovyan/demo`
 
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/explorejupyternotebooks/ECO_dr1_subset.csv -P /home/jovyan/demo`
 
 * Additionally, type this into the terminal to get the astroML package: `pip install astroML`
 * if necessary, click the refresh page (curled arrow) at the top of the webpage
 * launch the jupyter notebook by double clicking on it
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter
