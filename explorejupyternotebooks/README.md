## Exploring Jupyter Notebooks

Updated June 2021 by D. Carr

This tutorial is intended to be done in the Binder environment. To do this tutorial:
 * If you don't have Binder already loaded up, go to https://mybinder.org/ and enter the url "https://github.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp"
 * It can take up to 10 minutes to load the boot camp repo into Binder
 * After it is loaded, use the file explorer on the left to open the `ExploreEco.ipynb` file in the `explorejupyternotebooks` folder
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter. 

If the above instructions aren't working for you, feel free to use these alternative instructions to access the `exploreECO.ipynb` tutorial:


 * go to https://jupyter.org/try
 * click "Try JupyterLab"
 * close open tabs in the Lab (not necessary, just less confusing)
 * open a terminal in the Lab (File>New>Terminal)
 * paste the following lines into the terminal to get the jupyter notebook:<br/>
  
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/explorejupyternotebooks/ExploreECO.ipynb?token=AHJ5VUHE2TIJTDFMWSWZ3Q3AYJNOA -O /home/jovyan/demo/ExploreECO.ipynb`
 
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2021bootcamp/master/explorejupyternotebooks/ECO_dr1_subset.csv?token=AHJ5VUHX7IOUT4GQAXBOVJ3AYJNQQ -O /home/jovyan/demo/ECO_dr1_subset.csv`
 
 * Additionally, type this into the terminal to get the astroML package: `pip install astroML`
 * if necessary, click the refresh page (curled arrow) at the top of the webpage
 * launch the jupyter notebook by double clicking on it
 * you can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter.
