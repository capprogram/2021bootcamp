The tutorial assumes you will use the graphical Spyder interface in the Anaconda distribution of python, and explains how to install Anaconda. If you want to use Python in a terminal instead, look at these [alternative instructions and commands](https://github.com/capprogram/2017bootcamp-general/blob/master/ipython-terminal.md) for use with ipython on the linux command line. 

Here is a one page [Quick Reference](http://user.physics.unc.edu/~sheila/PythonQuickReference.pdf) for the commands used in this tutorial.
